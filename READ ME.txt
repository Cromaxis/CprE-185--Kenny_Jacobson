These files are from my work during CprE 185 during the Fall Semester 2017.
The code in the homework folder is from our homework assignments.
The code in the labs folder is from our labs and the accompanying lab report is included.
Many of the code requires an Esplora unit or a special file to run but this repository should showcase my abilities in coding using the C Language even if you can't run some of the programs.
